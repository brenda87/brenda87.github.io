Bizness" is your trusty training groundâ€”an easy box designed to warm up your hacking muscles. 

### Nmap Scan
Kicking off the mission, we deployed an Nmap scan on the target IP, uncovering the open ports and exposed services.

The Nmap scan was unproductive, so I added the target IP to /etc/hosts to access the website directly.

### Directory search

I conducted a directory search of the `bizness.htb` website using `dirsearch`, uncovering hidden directories and potentially vulnerable endpoints for further investigation.

I navigated to /bizness.htb/accounting/ and encountered a login page, indicating potential access to sensitive financial information or administrative controls.
