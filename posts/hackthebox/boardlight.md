`Boardlight` is an easy machine in HTB.

### Recon
### Nmap scan

Deployed an Nmap scan on the target IP, uncovering the open ports and exposed services.

After running an Nmap scan, I found two open ports: SSH and HTTP. The HTTP service was running Apache version 2.4.41, which had two low-risk vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-1927 and CVE-2020-1934). I didnâ€™t dive too deep into them since they were low risk.

Added the target IP to /etc/hosts to access the website directly.
