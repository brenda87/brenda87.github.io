`Boardlight` is an easy machine in HTB.

### Recon
### Nmap scan

Deployed an Nmap scan on the target IP, uncovering the open ports and exposed services.

After running an Nmap scan, I found two open ports: SSH and HTTP. The HTTP service was running Apache version 2.4.41, which had two low-risk vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-1927 and CVE-2020-1934). I didnâ€™t dive too deep into them since they were low risk.

Added the target IP to /etc/hosts to access the website directly.

### Directory search

I used `dirsearch` to search for directories but I didn't find any userful

I employed `ffuf` to scan for subdomains on `board.htb`, revealing the existence of `crm.board.htb`.

After adding crm.board.htb to /etc/hosts, I navigated to the website for further exploration.

I checked out the website and it opened up a Dolibarr page running version 17.0.0.

Searched for the default Dolibarr login and found that both the username and password are 'admin,' and it worked.

Then I searched for vulnerabilities in Dolibarr version 17.0.0 and came across CVE-2023-30253, which has a reverse shell PoC exploit.

I exploited the vulnerability and got a reverse shell.
